# WebRequest Helper

![ScreenShot](https://i.imgur.com/bqEwBeB.png)

A WebRequest helper, I made this to use instead of writing code in VB > Debugging > Tweaking variables > Recompiling. It uses a HTTPWebRequest Wrapper I wrote specifically for this, Just to cover the basics.

This is just a re-upload of a tool I wrote almost 9 Years ago. Upgraded to VS2019 and it still works just fine. Hopefully this will help someone learn.
